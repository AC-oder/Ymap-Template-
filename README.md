# Ymap-Template-Made by AC_oder 

Ymap Resource Template   
(This is probarly one of the easiest resources ever.)

Description:
This resource is for when those ymap creaters don't give you the stream folder or the resource.lua to put your ymaps in.

Installation:
1. Rename the folder to a random name.
2. Place your ymap(s) into the stream folder. That's it!
3. Drag and Drop the folder into your server resources folder.
4. Add it to your server.cfg (Example start Mansion)
5. Restart your server.

No support is given because it is the simplest script ever.
